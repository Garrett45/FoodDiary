# FoodDiary
This will eventually be an app that allows users to track nutritional information of what they eat throughout the day. Unlike other fitness apps like MyFitnessPal, the goal of this
app is not to enforce any specific diet, but rather to simply allow the user to track everything like a standard Food Journal or Library.
